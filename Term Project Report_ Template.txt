1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Statement
[Briefly restate the core problem you are solving. (1-2 paragraphs)]
1.2 Motivation
[Explain why this problem matters. Discuss the security impact and why a solution is necessary.]
1.3 Key Objectives
[List the 2-3 main objectives you proposed at the start of the term. These should match your initial proposal.]
* Objective 1: ...
* Objective 2: ...
2. Threat Model and Assumptions
2.1 Threat Model
[Describe your specific threat model. Define the attacker's capabilities clearly (e.g., Is the attacker an Insider or Outsider? Active or Passive? What resources do they have?)]
2.2 Key Assumptions
[List the critical assumptions made for your project (e.g., "We assume the attacker knows the SSID but not the WPA3 password").]
3. System Architecture & Methodology
3.1 High-Level Design
[Insert your final system Block Diagram here. Describe the overall architecture and data flow.]
3.2 Core Modules
[Describe the key components of your system (e.g., Attack Module, Detection Engine, Logging Server). Explain what each module does.]


4. Implementation Details
4.1 Hardware Setup
[List the hardware used (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, Alfa Wi-Fi Cards, Laptops). Include a diagram or photo of your physical testbed setup.]
4.2 Software Stack
[List the key libraries, tools, and frameworks used (e.g., hostapd, Scapy, Aircrack-ng, Python).]
4.3 Key Algorithms and Logic
[Provide the pseudo-code or a flowchart for the most critical part of your solution. Explain the logic behind your specific implementation.]
4.4 Code Structure
[Briefly describe how your code is organized in your repository (e.g., which script handles the attack vs. the defense).]


5. Experimental Setup & Evaluation
5.1 Testbed Environment
[Describe the environment where you ran your experiments (e.g., Lab setting, isolated network, specific distance between nodes).]
5.2 Test Scenarios
[List the specific scenarios you tested (e.g., "Scenario A: Weak Password", "Scenario B: WPA3-SAE Dictionary Attack").]
5.3 Metrics and Baselines
* Metrics: [What did you measure? (e.g., Handshake capture time, Decryption success rate, CPU load).]
* Baselines: [What are you comparing your results against? (e.g., Standard WPA2 performance, existing tools).]








6. Results and Analysis
6.1 Quantitative Results
[Insert your plots, graphs, and tables here. Ensure all axes are labeled and figures have captions.]
6.2 Analysis
[Crucial Section: Do not just describe the numbers. Explain why the results look the way they do. (e.g., "The capture time increased in Scenario B because of the additional SAE overhead...").]
6.3 Comparison with Objectives
[Review your objectives from Section 1.3. State the final status of each (Completed, Partially Completed, Infeasible) and explain any deviations.]
